TIP:

## Running the website

Step 1:

 Place your PHP files in the the file path **"C:\xampp\htdocs"** for your Web server. Make sure your PHP files are saved as such; they     must have the ".php" file extension.
 Open up any Web browser on your desktop and enter **"localhost"** into the address box. The browser will open a list of files 
 stored  under the "HTDocs" folder on your computer. Click on the link to a PHP file and open it to run a script.

Step 2:

Create any folders you need to test PHP files in under the "HTDocs" folder. If you create a folder named "scripts," then
 use the address "localhost/scripts" to open them in your browser.
